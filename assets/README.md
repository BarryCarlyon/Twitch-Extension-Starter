Twitch Extensionsions require a number of assets for the store page.

Theres:

- icon
- Store Discovery 
- Screenshots

An extension requires at least 1 screenshot and I'd recommend doing 3.

There are template files for Discover and screenshots.


Discovery needs to be 300px x 200px and PNG

Screenshots are 1024px x 768px and PNG

Icons have two sizes, both PNG, 100x100px and 24x20px
